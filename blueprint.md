# Takoyadon Rewards App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the blueprint for the Takoyadon Rewards web application. This application is designed to provide a comprehensive loyalty and rewards system for Takoyadon customers. It includes features for earning points, redeeming rewards, and managing user accounts. The system is built using a modern technology stack, including React, Vite, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React project structure, with all source code located in the `src` directory. Key directories include:

- `src/components`: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.
- `src/pages`: Includes the main pages of the application, such as the dashboard, rewards, and profile pages.
- `src/services`: Handles communication with external services, including the Supabase backend.
- `src/hooks`: Contains custom React hooks for managing state and other complex logic.
- `src/config`: Stores configuration files, such as constants and environment variables.

## Implemented Features

### User Authentication

-   **Supabase Auth UI**: The application uses the Supabase Auth UI for a seamless and secure authentication experience.
-   **Email/Password and Social Login**: Users can sign up and log in using their email and password or through social providers like Google and Facebook.
-   **Protected Routes**: The application uses protected routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages.

### Rewards and Loyalty

-   **Points System**: Customers can earn points by making purchases and completing other activities.
-   **Reward Redemption**: Points can be redeemed for various rewards, such as discounts and free products.
-   **Tiered Loyalty Program**: The application includes a tiered loyalty program that provides additional benefits to loyal customers.

### User Dashboard

-   **Points and Activity Tracking**: The user dashboard displays the user's current point balance and a history of their recent activity.
-   **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information, including their name, email, and password.
-   **Reward History**: The dashboard also shows a history of the rewards that the user has redeemed.

## Current Plan

My current plan is to continue developing the core features of the application and to improve the overall user experience. This includes:

-   **Error Resolution**: I will address any remaining errors in the application to ensure that it runs smoothly and without issues.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements**: I will continue to refine the user interface and user experience to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly.
-   **Performance Optimization**: I will work to optimize the performance of the application to ensure that it is fast and responsive.

By following this plan, I will create a high-quality and feature-rich rewards application that meets the needs of both the business and its customers.
